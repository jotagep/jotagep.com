ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the exciting adventure of web development. As it couldn't be any other way, I've decided to title the first post "Hello World," a clichÃ© in programming when starting out.

Before explaining what this blog will entail, I'd like to introduce myself so you can get to know me a little better. My name is [**Jorge G.PalacÃ­n**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jotagep/), and I'm currently 26 years old, with a passion for web technologies.

My primary passion, and full-time obsession, is **JavaScript**. Everything related to this programming language, which has gained so much importance in the last decade. For that reason, through this blog, I'll dedicate myself to teaching you about the new functionalities it offers.

The content of my blog will cover various technologies related to web development in JavaScript:

- **New functionalities**: ECMAScript 2015, ES6, Babel.
- **Use of frameworks**: Angular, React, Vue.
- **Mobile app development**: Ionic, Capacitor, Cordova.
- **UI/UX Design**: Adobe XD, Sketch, Figma.
- **Bundlers**: Webpack, Parcel.
- **Node.js**: REST API, OAuth.

And much more...

Above all, we will focus on creating tutorials and posts to learn about the "three kings" of web applications in the last two years: **React, Angular, and Vue.**

Join me on this journey and enhance your web knowledge to carry out that project you've always dreamed of but never dared to undertake.

Greetings to all, and I look forward to seeing you in upcoming posts.
